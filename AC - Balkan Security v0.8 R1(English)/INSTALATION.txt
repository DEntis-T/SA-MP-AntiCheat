PLEASE DON'T RENAME THIS ANTICHEAT !
LET'S START...  FIRST, IN ANTICHEAT YOU CAN FIND SOMTHING LIKE /// CHANGE ME IF YOU WANT, THAT MEANS TAHT YOU CAN CHANGE THAT, LIKE MAX PING
===================[INSTALATION]========================
ACBS.amx PUT IN YOUR filterscripts folder, then in server.cfg write ACBS, folder AC-BS move in your scriptfiles, pawno/include move in your pwano/include
(you must put AC_Balkan_Security include in you pawno includes) 
Then remove #error READ INSTALATION.TXT , and continue reading this!!
==========[ADMIN PROTECTION]==========
In your GameMode, under OnPlayerSpawn put: SetPVarInt(playerid, "AdminProtect", 0);
Then under your /adminduty command, when you go ON DUTY, put: SetPVarInt(playerid, "AdminProtect", 1);
but when you go off admin duty, put SetPVarInt(playerid, "AdminProtect", 0);
Doing that, evry time when you go on duty Admin will be protected, and anticheat cannot kick him.
=========[OTHER MOST IMPORTNENT CHANGES]==========
In you Game Mode, on top, put this:

#include <AC_Balkan_Security>

After that, command under this text, you need to change:

GivePlayerMoney
ResetPlayerMoney
SetPlayerMoney
SetPlayerHealth
SetPlayerArmour
SetPlayerPos
SetPlayerInterior
SetPlayerVirtualWorld

Commands above this text, you MUST change in command under this text (use ctrl + h):

AC_BS_GivePlayerMoney
AC_BS_ResetPlayerMoney
AC_BS_SetPlayerMoney
AC_BS_SetPlayerHealth
AC_BS_SetPlayerArmour
AC_BS_SetPlayerPos
AC_BS_SetPlayerInterior
AC_BS_SetPlayerVirtualWorld


Then in all you command what repair your vehicle, put this:

SetPVarInt(playerid, "VehicleRepair", 1);

Usualy there is only 1 command like that, so that won't be a problem!


Then under public OnPlayerConnect put next:

AC_BS_SetPlayerArmour(playerid, 0);
AC_BS_SetPlayerHealth(playerid, 100);

IF you din't do what is writen above, anticheat will kick for no reason!
